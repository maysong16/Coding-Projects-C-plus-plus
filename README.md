·	Magic Squares- a C++ program that utilizes nested for loops, multidimensional arrays, while loops, and methods to create ten different N*N magic squares, which are square matrices in which the sum of rows, columns, and diagonals are the same. The user chooses the value of N, which must be an odd number between 3 and 15.

·	Memory Allocator- a C++ program that emulates the operating system’s responsibility of allocating memory to certain programs, representing a simple page-based view of memory management. On startup, the program has 32 pages of contiguous, unused memory. It allows the users to “run” programs that require chunks of this memory and “kill” programs that are in progress. The program demonstrates understanding and practice with linked lists and pointers, while using best-fit and worst-fit algorithms for allocating fragmented memory.

·	Lexical Analysis of a Programming Language- a C++ program that illustrates capability with file reading, stack implementation, tokens, string processing, input parsing, and arrays. The program inputs a text file from the user, which contains the code they want the compilers to analyze. Then, the code parses the input, detects the tokens, classifies them, and prints out the results, which includes the keywords, identifiers, constants, operators, delimiters, syntax errors, and depth of nested for loops.
